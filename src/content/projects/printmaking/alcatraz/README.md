# Alcatraz

Prints of Alcatraz Island's industrial architecture — an etching and a linocut working from the same photographic reference to capture the layered, weathered structures.

The linocut version alongside the source photograph. The translation from photo to carved block strips away detail and flattens the image into bold lines and planes.
