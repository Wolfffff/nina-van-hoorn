# Tulip Variations

A single linocut block of tulips in a vase, explored through different printing and collage techniques — each pull a new interpretation of the same carved image.

The black-and-white pull is the starting point: the carved image in its simplest form.

Chine-collé with gold and tan tissue adds warmth and depth to the same impression.

Color paper collage transforms the print into something closer to painting — blocks of blue, brown, orange, and pink layered over and around the image.

Printed on translucent tissue paper, the image becomes fragile and luminous.

Printed on a page from a Danish book, the text bleeding through the image.

Printed on a torn road map, the geography of the page merging with the botanical subject.

A watercolor wash of peach and orange applied over the print.
