# About Nina van Hoorn

I'm Nina van Hoorn, a visual artist based in Princeton, New Jersey. My practice spans
printmaking, analog photography, and painting — mediums that share a tactile,
process-driven approach to image-making.

I'm drawn to the physicality of these techniques: the pressure of the printing
press, the chemistry of the darkroom, the layering of paint. Each medium offers
a different way to explore themes of landscape, memory, and texture.

My work often begins with observation — walks along the Jersey Shore, wandering
through urban spaces, studying botanical specimens. These experiences are
translated through slow, deliberate processes that reveal unexpected textures
and forms.
