# Coastal Linocuts

Multi-color reduction linocuts of the California coast — wildflower meadows giving way to rocky shoreline, sea stacks, and birds in flight.

The same carved block printed in different color passes produces distinct moods. A warm ochre-to-green palette evokes late afternoon light, while a blue-green version shifts the same landscape toward cooler, overcast conditions.

The carved woodblock itself — the matrix from which each print is pulled. The detailed carving of wildflowers, grasses, and rock formations is visible in the raw wood surface.
